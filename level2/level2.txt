1. In your own words, describe what JavaScript Code Style is.

    Answer: JavaScript Code style is different ways on how you code. Do you use tabs or 
            spaces as indentation. Do you use semicolons or not? 

            An example of using a bad Code style is to use double equal signs (==) instead 
            of tripple (===). Another example is to avoid using curly braces ({}) or brackets ([]).

            If you use as close as standard JS Code style it's way easier for other developers
            to be able to read your code.
